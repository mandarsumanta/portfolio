SUMANTA — YOUR WEBSITE

Files in this folder:
- index.html  -> your entire website
- resume.pdf  -> your résumé (already linked on the page)

HOW TO PUT THIS ONLINE (EASIEST):
1) Go to vercel.com and sign in with GitHub (make an account if needed).
2) Click "Deploy" then "Import Git Repository" is optional. Faster way:
   Click "Add New..." -> "Project" -> "Import" -> choose "Drag and Drop" (Upload).
3) Drag this WHOLE FOLDER onto Vercel. It will give you a live link.
   Done! Your site is live.

HOW TO USE GITHUB + VERCEL (slightly longer, but best):
1) Go to github.com -> New repository -> name: sumanta-portfolio -> Create.
2) On the repo page: Add file -> Upload files -> drag index.html and resume.pdf -> Commit.
3) On vercel.com -> Add New... -> Project -> pick sumanta-portfolio -> Deploy.
4) You’ll get a link like https://sumanta-portfolio.vercel.app

HOW TO EDIT:
- Open index.html in any text editor. Change links and text. Save.
- If using GitHub, upload the new index.html again (Commit). Vercel redeploys.
